apriori
- confidence: if A then B = conf(A>B) = AB/A 
- lift: if A then B = (A|B)/AB
  - ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent
  - 1 = independant
  - >1 = dependant
  - <1 = substitues; presence of one item has negative effect on presence of other item and vice versa
- conviction: if A then B = (1-B)/(1-conf(A>B))
  - the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions
  - e.g. 1.2 = incorrect 20% more often (1.2 times as often) if the association between X and Y was purely random chance
- maximal: no children are >frequent
- closed: all children have smaller count than it

to-do

plot: use -log p value for size
Color for increase/decrese

Instead of overlap: number of standard deviations of control between means

control: choose a random count for everything in the last row
Positive: increase on last layer count

Positive: abc random, def not random thresholds

Decrease size of lattice

change upper layer, descendants and non-descendants

Example posted on overleaf

Assume there will be no descendant/ancestor relationship between real changed cell populations
